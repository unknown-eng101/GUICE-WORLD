INTRODUCTION
Guices are a subspecies of eels, or Anguilliformes, the scientific name of eels.
Guices are more fat and dumb than regular eels. There consists of 2 subspecies of Guices.
	TYPES OF GUICES
	There are 2 subspecies, Donyaris Anguillus, and Onelous Anguillus. Donyaris Anguillus, AKA Donyars, and Onelous Anguillus, AKA Onels are one same species, Guiceille Anguillus, AKA, GUICE. Usually, the Onelous Anguillus is the more fatter and dumber species, but the Donyaris Anguillus is cuter than the Onelous Anguillus. Usually, the Onelous Anguillus species is the more dominant species. THE FATTER, UGLY, DUMB, ETC, THE HIGHER RANKING IN THE SOCIAL CLASS YOU ARE! EXCEPT FOR CUTENESS.
More About Guices
How a Guice is named:
Guices, and Gillies are all named after the famous Lizz, the first Guice according to the Guicle (Similar to a certain religious text), or the famous Fizz, brother, and started the first, and most famous kingdom, New Guice Kingdom. Rarr is the first Guice to achieve a high ranking in Guice World, despite being very strong. Last rank for Rarr: Vice Admiral. All names have to be either rhyming with Lizz, Fizz, and Rarr or spelled similar to Lizz, Fizz, or Rarr. e.g., Pizz is fine (pihz) or Rarr (rahr) Last name naming is pretty simple, anything that describes you is ok. Titles are only for the top 3 ranks (Explained later) starting with Paise - Commander, then Paieese - Great Commander, and finally, Paicer - Superior Great Commander.
Why Are Guices So Dumb?
The following is a research document from DeepCurrent Science Research Joint International (DCSRJ International)
Abstract

The Guiceille anguillus, a recently identified member of the Anguilliformes order, displays a marked decrease in cognitive function compared to its eel relatives. This species, notable for its highly oval body shape, disproportionately enlarged belly, minimal caudal structure, and extreme adiposity, provides a rare case study in morphological specialization at the cost of neurological capacity. Drawing upon comparative neurology, evolutionary theory, and metabolic constraint analysis, this paper investigates why G. anguillus is significantly less intelligent than other eels—both in behavior and neuroanatomy.

⸻

Introduction

Anguilliformes, commonly known as eels, are generally agile, adaptable fish with relatively high problem-solving capacity for teleosts. However, Guiceille anguillus, first described in 2023 from isolated marsh habitats in southern Madagascar, has baffled researchers with its unusually sluggish behavior, poor environmental awareness, and inability to navigate basic mazes or avoid simple threats—traits rarely seen in its taxonomic relatives.

⸻

Morphological Distinctions
	•	Body Shape: Unlike the streamlined, serpentine body typical of most eels, G. anguillus is distinctly ovoid—more reminiscent of a bloated jellybean than a typical eel.
	•	Fat Distribution: Over 68% of its body mass is subcutaneous fat, likely an adaptation to low-food environments. However, this trait appears to come at a significant neurological cost.
	•	Tail: The tail is underdeveloped, limiting propulsion and motor coordination, especially in complex environments.

⸻

Brain Structure and Neurological Deficit

Dissections and MRI studies show:
	•	Brain-to-body ratio: G. anguillus has the lowest encephalization quotient (EQ) of any known eel species (EQ = 0.014 vs. Anguilla anguilla’s EQ ≈ 0.18).
	•	Underdeveloped cerebrum: Regions associated with spatial memory and threat response are diminished.
	•	Excess glial tissue: Possibly a result of poor thermal regulation and metabolic inefficiency, excess fat around the cranium may limit synaptic efficiency and neuronal density.

⸻

Evolutionary Hypotheses
	1.	Energy Trade-Off Hypothesis
In nutrient-scarce environments, natural selection may have favored individuals capable of storing large fat reserves over those with higher brain energy demands. The brain, being metabolically expensive, was sacrificed in favor of fat storage—essentially a “dumb but full” survival strategy.
	2.	Predator Avoidance by Camouflage and Immobility
The thick, unmoving body of G. anguillus may make it appear as a rock or detritus, reducing predation risk. As a result, evolutionary pressure for intelligence-based escape behaviors diminished.
	3.	Reproductive Strategy Shift
Observations indicate G. anguillus breeds prolifically with minimal mating rituals. In contrast to other eels, which engage in complex behaviors during spawning, this species’ simplified behavior requires less cognitive function.

⸻

Behavioral Evidence
	•	G. anguillus failed to learn food locations over repeated trials.
	•	Demonstrates no observational learning, even when placed with more intelligent eels.
	•	Reacts with delayed motion to light, touch, and sound stimuli, indicating degraded sensory-motor integration.

⸻

Conclusion

Guiceille anguillus exemplifies an extreme case of evolutionary trade-off: high energy storage and morphological specialization at the cost of neurological function. Its unusually dumb behavior is not merely anecdotal but rooted in measurable physiological and evolutionary mechanisms. This species challenges assumptions that intelligence is always favored in evolution, providing a rare instance where stupidity appears to have been selected for—under very specific environmental pressures.

POLITICAL
KINGDOMS, CLANS, TRIBES
	The world of Guice also has kingdoms similar to our world. Great and strong, small and weak kingdoms. Think about it this way: Kingdoms are countries, clans are states, and tribes are the cities.
	Each kingdom also has its own laws, and ranks. The laws are pretty simple. If you are a higher ranking, in greeting, you must kiss the other lower ranking on the forehead. (For all Guices) Do not disobey an order if you are lower ranking. (Only applies to military personnel) 
PUNISHMENTS:
The regular punishment is a guice (Different from the species Guice) on the chest based on the scale of the crime. A guice is done by pressing your finger into the soft chest part and then petting it. Legend says that it makes you lose weight and although it does not hurt, it is a way of humiliation. There are worse punishments of torture so warning, these punishments are very graphic. 
GRAPHIC SECTION!!!!
Starting from the least of the worst, the criminal is escorted into a bright room with greenery and wellness products, and is forced to eat healthy and turn into a Gillie.
THIS NEXT PUNISHMENT IS EXTREMELY GRAPHIC!
The next punishment is to rub the criminal on the ground, and dip them into toilet water, making them humiliated, then washing them and turning them into a Gillie, and enemy of the kingdom, and exiled from the kingdom.
GRAPHIC SECTION ENDS HERE!

RANKINGS
RANKINGS:
The rankings are consisted of 8 general ranks based on how bad you are:

Gillie Ranks: (NOTICE! THESE RANKS ARE NOT MEANING ENEMIES OF THE GUICES, THEY ARE SIMPLY LOWER IN THE SOCIAL PYRAMID AND LESS RESPECTED!)
	Giller (Lowest rank, leader of the Gillies, and secret rank: only one in the world)
	Gillie (Second lowest and majority of the Gillie population) Estimated pop per clan: 165
	Guieese (Third lowest and the province leaders of the Gillies)Estimated pop: 140
Guice Ranks:
	Guice (Lowest of the Guice rank, majority of the Guice population) Estimated pop per clan: 375
	-This is the average spot where the Guices stay
	Paise (Third highest Guice rank, the leader of a province) Estimated pop: 145 Title: Commander
	Paieese (Second highest Guice rank, the leader of a kingdom) Known pop: 63 (63 known kingdoms) Title: Great Commander
	Paicer (Highest Guice rank, the leader of all the Guice, only one in the world) Title: Superior Great Commander
Superior Ranks:
	God (The creators of this world)

To make this clear, the worse you are, (fat, and dumb) the higher ranking you are. EXCEPT FOR CUTENESS!
There are more specific ranks, 127 ranks from prisoner to supreme god. These ranks are to help differentiate between the same general rank guice. Ex: Two Guices, one is a Upper Middle Class, and another is a General of the Army, but they are both Guices, the same general rank, the General of the Army would be higher ranking than the civilian.

Any species of Guice usually has a 7.26 chance of getting accepted, if the Guice gets denied, then they move down 2 general ranks: Paieese - Guice, and Paicer - Paise if denied. This is just a skim of the application paper. If there seems to be good traits and they are useful, then we accept)
